This is "sentiment-analysis-for-financial-news" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains the sentiments for financial news headlines from the perspective of a retail investor. The dataset contains two columns, "Sentiment" and "News Headline".
The sentiment can be negative, neutral or positive. 

I tried many classification models for this tricky NLP problem and found the Random Forest Classifier to make the best predictions.
